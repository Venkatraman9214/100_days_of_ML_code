# 100 days of ML code
This project documents my progress through the 100 days of Machine Learning Challenge.

## Day 1
I started Jason Brownlee's book "Master Machine Learning Algorithms - Dissocver how they work and Implement Them from Scratch" and studied 5 chapters. 
1. Introduction to the book
2. Terminology used to talk about data
3. Algorthims learn to map input to output
4. Difference between parametric and non-parametric algorithms. Examples of parametric algorithms include Logistic regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis, Perceptron. Examples of Non-parametric algorithms include Decision Trees, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, Neural Networks.
5. Difference between Supervised, Unsupervised and Semi-Supervised algorithms.
